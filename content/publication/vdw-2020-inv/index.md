abstract: In this work, we provide a variational lower bound that can be computed
  without expensive matrix operations like inversion. Our bound can be used as a drop-in
  replacement to the existing variational method of Hensman et al. (2013, 2015), and
  can therefore directly be applied in a wide variety of models, such as deep GPs
  (Damianou and Lawrence, 2013). We focus on the theoretical properties of this new
  bound, and show some initial experimental results for optimising this bound. We
  hope to realise the full promise in scalability that this new bound has in future
  work.
